### **Southern Iceland Adventure: A Week of Natural Wonders**  
My trip through the south of Iceland was nothing short of breathtaking. From towering waterfalls and black sand beaches to steaming lava fields and icy glaciers, every day was an adventure through some of the most stunning landscapes I’ve ever seen. Below, I’ve listed my itinerary, the activities we did, and valuable tips I learned along the way to help make your own Iceland trip unforgettable.

### **1. Time of Year and Weather**

**Best Time to Visit:**  
Each season in Iceland offers its own unique landscapes and activities. This itinerary is tailored for a late September trip, when snow hasn’t yet arrived, making roads easy to navigate and hikes free from heavy snow. Some places, like **Landmannalaugar**, can only be reached before winter begins. While the days are shorter (7-8 hours of daylight), this trade-off increases your chances of seeing the **Northern Lights**.

**Weather Expectations:**  
Expect **temperatures** between 40°F and 55°F (5°C to 13°C), with frequent rain and wind. Iceland’s weather is famously unpredictable, so pack for sudden changes—sunshine can quickly give way to rain or chilly winds. Waterproof layers and warm clothing are essential to staying comfortable outdoors.

### **2. Daily Activities and Routes**

This trip centers on the **south side of Iceland**, covering only a portion of the famed Golden Circle route. By focusing on this region, we were able to explore iconic natural landmarks while allowing enough time for hikes, scenic drives, and relaxation without rushing through the entire country. Here's a breakdown of our day-to-day activities and routes.

#### **Day 1 – Arrival & The Golden Circle**  
We land in Keflavik at 6:15 AM and pick up our rental car from Blue Car Rental. After grabbing groceries at Krónan, we begin our drive toward the famed Golden Circle. 
- **Thingvellir National Park**: Stroll between the rift of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This park offers easy walking trails through impressive fissure zones, leading to the scenic **Öxarárfoss Waterfall**.
- **Kerid Crater**: A quick but stunning stop to admire the vibrant red and green hues of this volcanic crater filled with a bright blue lake.
- **Geysir & Gullfoss**: Witness the power of Iceland’s most famous geyser and the stunning, multi-tiered **Gullfoss** waterfall, two must-see Golden Circle highlights.

**Bonus**: Stop by **Laugarvatn Fontana** for a unique geothermal bread experience. The nearby **spa** is a perfect spot to relax and unwind after a day of driving and sightseeing.

#### **Day 2 – Highland Adventures: Landmannalaugar**
This activity is only accessible before October 1, and it became clear why when we arrived—the ground was already muddy and slippery, signaling the end of the hiking season.

<div class="paragraphs" markdown="1">
- **Drive to Landmannalaugar**: The 3-hour scenic drive into the highlands takes you through volcanic landscapes.
   - There are multiple routes to reach Landmannalaugar. Some includes river crossings, which requires a high-clearance vehicle and closes even earlier in the season. Make sure your vehicle is equipped and permitted to do river crossings.
   - All routes to Landmannalaugar involve driving on **F-roads**—unpaved, rugged roads in the Iceland’s highlands. Ensure your rental is allowed to drive on these roads, as not all rentals are suitable for this terrain.
- **Hikes**: The **Laugahraun Lava Field** and **Blahnúkúr Brennisteinsalda Loop** are challenging but rewarding hikes through surreal landscapes of lava fields, steaming fumaroles, and colorful rhyolite peaks.

#### **Day 3 – South Coast Exploration**
- **Dyrhólaey & Reynisfjara Beach**: Dyrhólaey is known for its arch-shaped cliff, while Reynisfjara features a black sand beach, striking sea stacks, and columnar basalt formations—perfect for dramatic coastal views.
- **Svartifoss Waterfall & Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon**: These hikes are highlights for nature lovers and photographers. Svartifoss stands out with its unique black basalt columns, and Fjaðrárgljúfur offers sweeping canyon views with scenic lookout points.

**Bonus**: For a quirky lunch stop, try the school bus café in Vik! It’s a fun, casual spot with local fare.

#### **Day 4 – Glacier Lagoon & Diamond Beach**
- **Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon**: Discover the stunning icebergs floating in the lagoon and consider booking the **Vatnajökull Ice Cave Tour** for an unforgettable experience inside one of Iceland’s iconic glaciers.
  - While the tour usually doesn’t open until October 1, we were fortunate to find a late September option. The later in the season you visit, the clearer and bluer the ice caves become. However, since we were early in the season, the glacier and cave were still covered in soot and ash, but we still caught glimpses of the mesmerizing ice blue interiors.
- **Diamond Beach**: Take a stroll along the black sand beach, where sparkling icebergs washed ashore create a breathtaking spectacle resembling scattered diamonds.

**Tip**: Pack a thermos with hot drinks to stay warm as you admire the mesmerizing glacial scenery. It’s the perfect way to enjoy the view while keeping cozy.

#### **Day 5 – Waterfalls and Reykjavik**

Drive back to Reykjavik, stopping by iconic waterfalls along the way:

- **Skogafoss & Seljalandsfoss Waterfalls**: Start your day with a visit to Skogafoss, where you can admire its powerful cascade and capture breathtaking photos. Don’t miss the chance to hike behind Seljalandsfoss for a unique perspective, allowing you to experience the beauty of the waterfall from behind the curtain of water.
  
- **Explore Reykjavik**: After your waterfall adventures, spend your afternoon wandering the vibrant capital. Visit **Hallgrimskirkja Church**, an architectural masterpiece with a stunning tower that offers panoramic views of the city. Then, head to the **Harpa Concert Hall**, renowned for its striking glass facade and hosting various cultural events.

- **Sky Lagoon**: End your day with a relaxing soak at the Sky Lagoon, especially during sunset. This geothermal spa is the perfect way to unwind after a long day of exploring and driving, offering a serene atmosphere to reflect on your unforgettable Icelandic adventure.

### **3. Packing Essentials**

Here’s a breakdown of key items you’ll need for this late September itinerary, with consideration for weather and activities. Keep in mind, this will vary depending on when you visit.

#### **Clothing**  
- **Warm layers**: Thermal top and bottom, sweatshirt, lined leggings, and sweatpants to keep warm in the cool fall temperatures.
- **Waterproof top layers**: A snowboard jacket for warmth and a rain jacket to stay dry during rain showers.
- **Footwear**: Sturdy, waterproof hiking boots and thick socks are must-haves for exploring waterfalls, glaciers, and volcanic terrain.
- **Accessories**: Gloves, scarf, and beanies are essential to protect against wind and cold, especially during glacier tours and windy days on the coast.

#### **For Hiking & Outdoor Activities**  
- **Hand warmers**: Perfect for glacier tours or early morning hikes to keep your hands warm.
- **Cooler bag**: Handy for keeping groceries fresh on long driving days between stops.
- **Swimsuit**: Don’t forget this for geothermal spas like **Sky Lagoon** or **Laugarvatn Fontana**.

#### **Other Essentials**  
- **Power adapters**: Iceland uses Type C and F outlets—bring an adapter for your devices.
- **Reusable water bottle**: Tap water in Iceland is exceptionally pure, so bring a bottle to refill.
- **Aluminum foil/sandwich bags**: Great for packing snacks or sandwiches during hikes or road trips.

This list will shift depending on the season you visit, with colder months requiring more insulation, and summer visits calling for lighter layers. Always check weather updates and activity requirements before packing!

### **4. Tips and Tricks for a Smooth Trip**

Here are some practical tips to make your Iceland adventure go smoothly:

- **Plan for Groceries**: Stock up on food early at grocery stores like **Krónan**, especially if you’ll be in remote areas with fewer dining options. Bring a cooler bag and sandwich bags for packing on-the-go meals during your drives or hikes.

- **Book Tours Early**: Popular tours like glacier hikes and ice cave explorations fill up fast, so book them well in advance, particularly if you’re visiting during peak season or plan on going to less accessible areas like **Landmannalaugar**.

- **Rent a 4WD Vehicle**: For accessing rugged regions and navigating **F-roads** (unsealed highland roads), a 4WD vehicle is essential. Not all rental cars are allowed on these roads, so check your rental agreement carefully.

- **Download Offline Maps**: In remote parts of Iceland, cell service can be limited. Download offline maps through apps like Google Maps or have a GPS system in the car to avoid getting lost.

- **Gas Station Tips**: Icelandic gas stations often require a PIN for credit card purchases, which can be tricky for U.S. cardholders. Even after requesting a PIN from my credit card provider, it still wouldn’t work. **OB gas stations**, however, don’t require a PIN, making them a reliable option. Plus, with **Blue Car Rentals**, we received a discount card for OB purchases.

  Also, be aware that gas stations will place a hold on your card for around $200 (USD) per transaction. These are temporary charges and will clear after a few days.

- **Pack for All Weather**: Iceland's weather is highly unpredictable, so always pack layers, windproof jackets, and waterproof hiking boots. Even in late September, you may encounter rain, wind, and sun all in one day.

- **Relax and Enjoy the Views**: Iceland has stunning scenery, and it's easy to get caught up in a packed itinerary. Be sure to schedule downtime for spontaneous stops or a peaceful soak in a geothermal spa.
