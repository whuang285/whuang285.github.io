A 3-day trip from Las Vegas, we delved into the majestic canyons, a captivating segment of our larger Vegas adventure.

# Itinerary
Commencing and concluding in Las Vegas, with a flight in from New York City, our journey unfolded with a car rental pickup, a night's stay at a hotel, and a Shin Lim show on the strip before starting our trip the next morning. 

## Overview: The 4 main legs of the road trip
1. Las Vegas -> Hoover Dam -> Grand Canyon (4 hours)
2. Grand Canyon -> Antelope Canyon and Horseshoe Bend (2.5 hours)
3. Antelope Canyon -> Zion National Park (2.5 hours)
4. Zion National Park -> Las Vegas (2.5 hours)

## Day 1: Las Vegas to Grand Canyon (South Rim)
### Las Vegas -> Hoover Dam -> Grand Canyon (4 hours)
Starting from Las Vegas, our 4-hour drive to the Grand Canyon unfolded with a scenic route past the iconic Hoover Dam. While we didn't venture inside, a brief stopover at a lookout point offered a glimpse of its grandeur. Arriving at the Yavapai Lodge in the afternoon, we boarded their shuttle to Hopi Point and Mohave Point, savoring the panoramic views. (**Note:** *Hermit Road is only accessible via shuttle bus from March 1 to November 30*) 

### Sunset at Grand Canyon (Hopi vs. Mohave)
Both Hopi and Mohave point give great views of the canyon at sunset. Hopi extends further north and gives a nice 180 view of the canyon, while Mohave's view gets a bit blocked by Hopi. One of the nicest views isn't the setting sun but the glow it casts on the rest of the canyon while setting. This means that Hopi Point blocks the east side of the canyon from Mohave Point. However, the downside of Hopi Point is that the return shuttle does **not** stop there and you're stuck there until you hike over to Mohave to catch the shuttle back after sunset.

Opting for Maricopa Point as our starting point, we trekked to Hopi Point, relishing its expansive vistas before proceeding to Mohave Point for a stunning sunset spectacle. Lucky for us, the return shuttle came right after sunset, so we were back at the lodge in no time.

Another thing to note is that the temperature at night varies drastically from the day. Temperature dropped drastically after sunset and I would recommend bringing a jacket.


## Day 2: Grand Canyon to Antelope Canyon
### Sunrise at Grand Canyon (Yavapai Point)
Before bidding adieu to the Grand Canyon, we caught the sunrise at Yavapai Point, marveling at nature's canvas. Yaki Point offers another prime sunrise spot, albeit with a hike or shuttle ride due to limited parking. It's further north east and has a great view westward into the canyon. Yavapai Point, on the other hand, is part of the Geology Museum and boasts ample parking for those who prefer to drive.

### Grand Canyon -> Antelope Canyon (2.5 hours)

It's a 2.5-hour drive from the Grand Canyon to Antelope Canyon. Remember, you'll need to book a reservation with a tour group to get access to Antelope Canyon, and they all kick off in Page, AZ. The tours last about 1.5 hours each. Now, Antelope Canyon comes in two flavors: Upper and Lower. The Upper one's shaped like an "A," making it perfect for those iconic light beams. Meanwhile, the Lower Canyon's is the shape of a "V".

**Note:** Pay attention to time changes when passing through the Navajo Reservation en route from the Grand Canyon to Page. The Reservation observes daylight savings time, unlike the rest of Arizona. This means time variations depending on the season, as Arizona doesn't adjust its clocks. Page itself operates on Arizona time, not Reservation time. Be wary of tour times, as your cell signal might connect to a Reservation tower, causing your phone's time to be off by an hour. To avoid confusion, consider manually setting your phone's time to a specific location rather than relying on automatic updates.

### Horseshoe Bend (bonus)
Nearby in Page, AZ, **Horseshoe Bend** beckoned with its natural splendor, accessible via a leisurely 30-minute stroll.

### Lodging
After the tour, we chose to skip staying overnight in Page, AZ. Since our next stop on the road trip was Zion Canyon National Park, we decided to find accommodation closer to the park. So, we spent the night in Kanab, UT, which was a two-hour drive from Page, AZ, and just a half-hour drive to Zion's east entrance.

## Day 3: Zion

Arriving early is key as parking spots inside the park fill up fast. We found ourselves in a line at the park's opening at 8 AM. The main parking lot sits right by the south entrance. Opting for the east entrance not only spared us the south entrance traffic but treated us to stunning views driving up the eastern part of Zion. Just a heads up, there aren't clear signs for the parking lot coming from the northeast, so watch out to avoid overshooting it and ending up out of the park.

Zion boasts two famous hikes: Angel's Landing and the Narrows. Both are tough climbs. Angel's Landing requires a permit booked in advance, while the Narrows' hike depends on river conditions. Unfortunately, during our visit, the river was too swift, so the trail was closed.

But fear not, there are plenty of easier, shorter hikes in Zion to enjoy its beauty. The Riverside Walk is a breezy, scenic stroll leading to the Narrows trailhead. Meanwhile, the Emerald Pools Trails offer picturesque hikes to higher elevations and, you guessed it, the Emerald Pools.

### Zion -> Las Vegas (2.5 hours)
After spending the morning exploring Zion, we departed, regretfully unable to extend our adventure to Bryce Canyon. We recommend making a detour for future travelers, as Bryce Canyon, just an hour away, is definitely worth a visit before heading back to Las Vegas. So, bidding farewell to the captivating canyons, we journeyed back to the neon lights of Vegas.
