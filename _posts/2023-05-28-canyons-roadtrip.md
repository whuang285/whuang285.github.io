We did a 3 day roadtrip to the canyons starting in Las Vegas. This was a 3 day section of a longer Las Vegas trip.

# Itinerary
Our trip started and ended in Las Vegas (flying in from New York City). We picked up our car rental, stayed a night at a hotel, watched a Shin Lim show on the strip and then started our trip the next morning. 

## Overview: The 4 main legs of the road trip
1. Las Vegas -> Hoover Dam -> Grand Canyon (4 hours)
2. Grand Canyon -> Antelope Canyon and Horseshoe Bend (2.5 hours)
3. Antelope Canyon -> Zion National Park (2.5 hours)
4. Zion National Park -> Las Vegas (2.5 hours)

## Day 1: Las Vegas to Grand Canyon (South Rim)
### Las Vegas -> Hoover Dam -> Grand Canyon (4 hours)
The drive from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon took around 4 hours with no pitstops. The drive will take you past the Hoover Dam (an hour out of Las Vegas). There's a lookout point where you can pull over to see the dam. You can also pay to enter to take a closer look at the dam, but we did not do this. We spent half an hour at the lookout point and continued our drive to the Grand Canyon. 

Our destination in the Grand Canyon was the Yavapai Lodge, where we will be spending the night. After arriving in the afternoon, we parked the car at the lodge and took their shuttle to Hopi Point and Mohave Point. (**Note:** *Hermit Road is only accessible via shuttle bus from March 1 to November 30*) 

### Sunset at Grand Canyon (Hopi vs. Mohave)
Both Hopi and Mohave point have great views of the canyon for sunset. Hopi extends further north and therefore has a nice 180 view of the canyon while part of the view at Mohave is blocked by Hopi Point. One of the nicest views isn't the setting sun but the glow it casts on the rest of the canyon while setting. This means that Hopi Point blocks the east side of the canyon from Mohave Point. However, the downside of Hopi Point is that the return shuttle does **not** stop there and you will have to hike to Mohave Point to catch the return shuttle after sunset. 

We decided to get off the shuttle at Maricopa Point and hike to Hopi Point. After spending a couple minutes enjoying the view at Hopi Point, we continued our hike to Mohave Point for sunset which allowed us to hop on the return shuttle back to the lodge that arrived right after sunset.

Another thing to note is that the temperature at night varies drastically from the day. Temperature dropped drastically after sunset and I would recommend bringing a jacket.


## Day 2: Grand Canyon to Antelope Canyon
### Sunrise at Grand Canyon (Yavapai Point)
Since we staying inside the Grand Canyon, we had to catch the sunrise at Yavapai Point before we left. Another great option is Yaki Point for the sunrise. Yaki Point is further north east and so will have a great view west into the canyon. However, there weren't any parking near there and one would have to hike there or take the shuttle. Yavapai Point is part of the Geology Museum and has a large parking lot for those who would rather drive.

### Grand Canyon -> Antelope Canyon (2.5 hours)
<div class="section" markdown="1">
<div class="paragraphs" markdown="1">
The drive from the Grand Canyon to Antelope Canyon will take 2.5 hours. A reservation with a tour group is needed to access Antelope Canyon. The tours all start in Page, AZ and are roughly 1.5 hours long. Antelope Canyon is divided into Upper and Lower - 2 separate tours. The Upper Antelope Canyon takes the form of the letter "A" which allows for the light beams. The Lower Antelope Canyon is a "V" shape.

**Note:** The Navajo Reservation follows daylight savings time while the rest of Arizona does not. When driving to Page from the Grand Canyon, you will pass through the Reservation so take note of the time changes (depending on the time of year, the time inside Arizona and the Navajo Reservation can be different). Page is not in the Navajo Reservation and follows Arizona time. Be careful with the tour times as sometimes your cell will continue pinging a cell tower inside the Reservation and the time on your cell will be an hour off. It is recommended to set your cell phone time to a specific location instead of letting it automatically update.

### Horseshoe Bend (bonus)
Also located nearby in Page, AZ is **Horseshoe Bend**. It is accessed by an easy 30-minute walk.

### Lodging
We decided to drive through Page, AZ after the tour and not stay overnight in the town. The next stop in the roadtrip is Zion Canyon National Park so we decided to stay closer to the park. We stayed overnight in Kanab, UT - a 2 hour drive away from Page, AZ and a 30 minute drive to the east entrance of Zion.

## Day 3: Zion

Parking inside the park fills up early so it is recommended to arrive early. The park opens at 8AM and there was a already a line in. The main parking lot is right by the south entrance to the park. Entering from the east entrance allowed us to avoid all the traffic from the south entrance and the views driving up the eastern portion of Zion was beautiful. There is no clear sign pointing to the parking lot coming down from the northeast so pay attention not to overshoot it and drive out of the park.

There are 2 main hikes Zion is known for: Angel's Landing and the Narrows. They're both rated as difficult climbs. Angel's Landing needs a permit reserved ahead of time and the Narrows requires the river condition to be just right. Unfortunately, while we were there the river was flowing too fast for us to hike through it and the trail was closed. 

There are also many easier and shorter hikes in Zion that allows you to take in its beauty. The *Riverside Walk* takes you to the start of the Narrows trail and is an easy and scenic walk. The *Emerald Pools Trails* are also some nice hikes that takes you to higher elevations and to the Emerald Pools.

### Zion -> Las Vegas (2.5 hours)
We spent roughly 4 hours hiking and exploring the park but there was so much more one could see in the area, such as Bryce Canyon an hour away. Would recommend checking it out before going to Zion and spending an extra night in the Zion area. We, however, were not able to do this and drove back to Las Vegas that evening.
