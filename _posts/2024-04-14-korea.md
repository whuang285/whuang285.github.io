I hope that this post will help people planning their own adventure in South Korea. From essential apps to money-saving tips, it covers everything you need to know before you go. Plus, it's packed with must-see sights and experiences in Seoul, Busan, and Jeju, ensuring your trip is filled with unforgettable moments.

# Preparing for Your Adventure

Before you embark on your South Korean odyssey, it’s essential to arm yourself with the right tools and information. Here are some handy tips to ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip:


## Essential Apps
* Naver or KakaoMap: Given that Google Maps might not be up-to-date, these local navigation apps will be your lifeline.
* Subway Korea: Navigate Seoul's intricate transit system with ease.
* KakaoT: Don't rely solely on Uber; this local taxi app will come in handy for getting around.

## Money Matters
When it comes to managing your finances during your South Korea trip, a little preparation can go a long way. Here are some essential tips to ensure you're covered:
* **T-Money Card**: Keep cash handy to top up your T-Money card for hassle-free subway rides. This reloadable card is a convenient way to navigate Seoul's extensive public transportation network.
* **Cash vs. Card**: While credit cards are widely accepted, it's always prudent to carry some cash, especially for those charming local eateries and market stalls that might prefer cash transactions.
* **Currency Exchange**: Maximize your travel funds by exchanging your currency upon arrival in Korea for the best rates. Incheon Airport boasts numerous currency exchange counters, making it easy to get Korean won right after you land.

Additionally, it's wise to come prepared for any unforeseen circumstances. I highly recommend bringing along an emergency cash stash and obtaining a debit card that doesn't charge ATM or international fees, like the Charles Schwab debit card. Not only does it save you from unnecessary fees, but it also reimburses any charges imposed by ATM machines. Personally, I found this setup invaluable during my trip. Despite not tapping into my emergency cash reserve, I was reassured by the accessibility of global ATMs, especially those conveniently located at Incheon Airport, just after customs and baggage claim, near multiple exit points.

# Seoul: Where Tradition Meets Modernity
