This post details a two-week journey through Taiwan, encompassing both Taipei and Hualien. With insights into local attractions, dining options, transportation tips, and day trip recommendations, I hope for this to serve as a valuable resource for travelers planning to explore Taiwan.

# Taipei

Taipei served as our primary base, from which we embarked on [day trips](#taipei-day-trips) to neighboring towns. Since day trips can be exhausting, I suggest spacing them out and incorporating rest days in between. On these rest days, we delved into the myriad attractions and culinary delights Taipei has to offer. Here's a glimpse of our Taipei explorations.

## Things to do
1. **2/28 Peace Park**: A serene retreat near Taipei Main Station, ideal for relaxation.
2. **Dajia Riverside Park**: Perfect for jogging or enjoying a leisurely stroll along the river.
3. **SOGO shopping mall**: A vast indoor complex with diverse shops, ideal for rainy days.
4. **Da-an Forest Park**: A picturesque destination for nature lovers and birdwatchers.
5. **Taipei 101**: Iconic skyscraper offering panoramic views of Taipei and beyond.

## Things to eat
1. **Liu Shandong Beef Noodle**: good beef noodle place near Taipei main station
2. **Yongkang Beef Noddles**: popular beef noodle place in Da'an
3. **Tian Jin Onion Pancake**: also in Da'an
4. **Jin Feng Braised Pork Rice**: popular braised pork rice place near Da'an
5. **Din Tai Fung**: soup dumplings
6. **Dragon Restaurant**: highly recommend reserving on of their peking ducks
7. **Addiction Aquatic Development**: amazing sushi sets for a reasonable price
8. **Sunnyhill Pineapple Cake Store**: recommend visitng their flagship store and sampling their teas and pineapple cakes
9. **Chia Te Bakery**: known for their pineapple cakes

# Taipei Day Trips
## Day Trip: Taipei Zoo and Maokong
The Taipei Zoo, located at the end of the brown MRT line (*Admission Fee: NT$60*), is the starting point for the Maokong Gondola. After exploring the zoo in the morning, hop on the Maokong Gondola for stunning views of the city skyline during the ride to Maokong.

{: .box-warning}
Note: The Maokong Gondola is closed for maintenance on Mondays.

### Things to do in Maokong
Maokong is renowned for its teahouses and plantations. Enjoy authentic tea ceremonies and local teas at places like Yaoyue Teahouse. Take a leisurely stroll through the many tea plantations. Visit the Taipei Tea Promotion Center and the Tea Master Chang Nai-Miao Memorial Hall to delve into Taiwan's tea culture.

## Day Trip: Hushan Hiking
The east side of Taipei boasts four hiking trails collectively known as SiShouShan (Four Beasts Mountain): Shishan (Lion Mountain), Hushan (Tiger Mountain), Baoshan (Leopard Mountain), and Xiangshan (Elephant Mountain). Xiangshan, situated at the end of the red MRT line, is the most frequented due to its proximity to central Taipei and breathtaking cityscape views.

Hushan, though less renowned, offers a similarly stunning vista of the city and is notably easier to ascend. It requires a slightly longer commute from the metro lines, necessitating either a bus ride or an additional 15-minute walk. I recommend commencing the hike at the entrance of Songshan Ci Hui Temple and concluding at Songshan Fengtian Temple. This 2.1-mile loop trail is well-marked with signs guiding hikers to various peaks.

{: .box-note}
<div class="section" markdown="1">
### Bonus: Roahe Night Market
<p style="margin: 0;">
Located a 30-minute walk north of Hushan, Raohe Night Market offers a great way to conclude your day. As one of the city's oldest night markets, it presents a plethora of local delicacies to indulge in. Some popular options include Black Pepper Buns, Stinky Tofu, Dorayaki, Deep-Fried Potato Spiral, and Oyster Omelets.
</p>
</div>

## Day Trip: Yehliu Geopark, Shifen, Jiufen
A popular day trip from Taipei includes visits to Yehliu Geopark, Shifen, and Jiufen.

### How to get to the locations

#### Tour Packages
[KKDay](https://www.kkday.com/) and [Klook](https://www.klook.com) offers many variations of this tour package. These tours will have shuttle buses to take you to the different locations and is usually on a set schedule and timeline. 

#### Private Car
Another option is to hire a private driver (can also be found on KKDay or Klook) that will take you to the different locations - most drivers are familiar with this type of day trip and will even offer suggestions on where to go. Going with a private driver will allow you to customize the destinations and the amount of time spent at each destination. These can usually be booked for around NT$7000.

#### Train and Bus
It is possible to take public transportation to all these locations but will take much longer than the above options. *If you were to take this option then I would recommend only going to 2 of the 3 places.* 

1. **Yehliu**: Multiple buses/trains serve Yehliu. A direct option is the *1815E* bus, taking about an hour from Taipei, costing around NT$90.
2. **Shifen Old Street**: From Taipei or Yehliu, travelers need to reach Keelung City and transfer to another bus or train. The quickest route from Keelung is a 30-minute bus ride on *Bus F825*, alighting at Shifenliao Bridge. 
	1. To reach Keelung City from Taipei, take *Bus 1815*.
	2. From Yeliu, various buses, including *Shuttle Bus 953*, *Bus 790*. and *Bus 1815A*, go to Keelung City.
3. **Jiufen Old Street**: To reach Jiufen from Shifen, take the Pingxi Small Train to Ruifang and then transfer to *Bus 788* or *Bus 965*.
4. **Back to Taipei**: From Jiufen, take *Bus 1062* back to the city. (*Note the last departure time [here](https://www.taiwanbus.tw/eBUSPage/Query/QueryResult.aspx?rno=10620&rn=1612169853723)*)

### Yehliu Geopark
Situated an hour's drive from Taipei on the northern shore of Taiwan, Yehliu Geopark boasts stunning natural rock formations. Notable among them is the Queen's Head. It's advisable to arrive in the morning to avoid the scorching afternoon sun, as shade is limited. A typical visit lasts around an hour, exploring the diverse formations. 

<div class="section" markdown="1">
<div class="paragraphs" markdown="1">
### Shifen Old Street

Following Yehliu, a 30-minute drive takes you to Shifen Old Street. Shifen is renowned for its Sky Lantern releases along the still-active old train tracks. Numerous shops line the tracks, offering lanterns for visitors to inscribe messages and release into the sky while standing on the tracks. These shops assist in setting up and preparing the lanterns, even capturing photos of the lantern release on the tracks. Opting for a store further down the tracks offers the same pricing with fewer crowds. Adding to the unique charm of this experience, the old train passes through Shifen approximately every 30 minutes, prompting everyone to temporarily vacate the tracks.

Additionally, Shifen Waterfall is a short bike ride away, a popular activity if time permits. Bike rentals are available in town. (If you have a private driver, they can also drive you there.)

</div>
<div class="paragraphs" markdown="1">
A 30-minute drive from Shifen leads to Jiufen Old Street, known for its resemblance to the downtown depicted in the popular Studio Ghibli movie Spirited Away. The street is adorned with numerous food stalls and tea houses. Noteworthy is the *Yu Zai Fan Shu Tea Stall*, offering food and tea with a breathtaking view of the mountains and ocean. The narrow alleyways of Jiufen are filled with pottery shops and souvenir stores, bustling with activity. It's recommended to explore freely, following whatever catches your interest.

### Bonus: Houtong Cat Village
<p style="margin: 0;">
Between Shifen and Jiufen lies Houtong, a small village famous for its stray cats. If time allows, it's a charming place to stop and interact with these lovely felines.
</p>
</div>

## Day Trip: Tamsui District
Tamsui is a coastal distrct to the west of Taipei. It is location at the west end of the red MRT line.

{: .box-warning}
Note: Only every other train on the red line travels to Tamsui. The other trains terminate at the preceding stop, Beitou. Should you board the wrong train, there's no need to worry. Simply disembark at Beitou and await the next train, which will proceed to Tamsui.

Upon arrival at the Tamsui MRT station, you have the option to stroll along the walking path to the Riverside Promenade, leading to Tamsui Old Street and the Fisherman's Wharf. Alternatively, you can opt for a ferry ride across the river to Bali Old Street.

Another nice activity is taking a [YouBike](#youbike) and cycling along the river to Beitou, with an added treat of exploring the magnolia forest along the way.

## Day Trip: Beitou Spa
Beitou is renowned for its abundance of hot springs and spas, catering to various budgets, from affordable options to luxurious retreats. While public hot springs are accessible to all visitors, establishments also provide private hot spring experiences, typically designed for two people.

{: .box-warning}
Many Beitou public hot springs are divided by gender and unless specified, are nude. There are some public outdoor mixed-gender hot springs that will require conservative bathing suit. 

Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that Beitou Thermal Valley, a popular attraction, is closed on Mondays.

## 2-Days Trip: Kaohsiung and Tainan
Kaoshiung and Tainan are cities on the sourthern end of Taiwan and are farely easy to get to on the High Speed Rail (HSR). Each city in itself can be it's own day trip but would recommend hitting the 2 cities on consecutive days and spending the night in one of the southern cities - so as to save time not going up and down the entire west coast of Taiwan. 

{: .box-note}
<div class="section" markdown="1">
### HSR Pass
<p style="margin: 0;">
The [3-Day Pass](https://pass.thsrc.com.tw/oatsb2c/home.do) is a great deal when needing to travel more than one city on the HSR. It offers unlimited rides on the HSR for 3 consecutive days for NT$2200. An individual ticket one-way between Taipei and Tainan is already NT$1080.
</p>
</div>

### Kaoshiung
Kaoshiung is the last stop on the HSR (Zuoying Station). (There are coin lockers at the station to store luggages)

#### Things to do

<div class="section" markdown="1">
<div class="paragraphs" markdown="1">
1. **Qijin Island**: The Qijin Island is off the coast of Kaoshiung and you can get there by ferry, train/bus, or car.  The most direct way to get to the northern end of the island is by taking one of the ferries. The ferry leaving from Shaochuantou/Gushan Ferry Pier is cheaper and runs more frequently. The other ferry leaves from the KW2 Ferry Pier - it is more expensive but allows you to explore the KW2 shopping mall while waiting for the ferry. 
	
	Biking down the island is a popular activity and there are many shops renting out tandem bikes. There are also many [YouBikes](#youbike) on the island that are much cheaper. 
2. **Dome of Light**: A light installation inside Formosa Boulevard Station.
3. **Dragon and Tiger Pagodas (Lotus Pond)**: Two pagodas that sit on the lotus pond. 
4. **Fo Guang Shang Monestery**: an hour outside of the city lies a sprawling monestery

#### Things to eat
1. Soup Dumpings and Pork Buns
2. **Old New Taiwanese Cuisine**: 7- to 8-course omakase menus offered at different price points featuring traditional banquet cooking

#### Bonus: Kaohsiung Lodging
<p style="margin: 0;">
The KW2 Ferry Pier has a hostel connected to it that is private and clean.
</p>
</div>

### Tainan
Tainan is one stop north of Kaoshiung on the HSR. (One thing to note is that the HSR train station is a bit out of town and there is no convenient way to Tainan city central using public transportation. I would recommend calling an Uber or taxi, especially if arriving late at night.)

#### Things to do
1. **Shennong Street**
2. **Chikan Tower**
3. **Sicao Green Tunnel**: take a boat tour through a tunnel made of mangrove trees
4. **Biking**: enjoy the the view from Sicao Bridge (between the Sicao Green Tunnel and Anping)
5. **Anping Old Fort & Treehouse**
6. **Snail Alley**: try and find all the snails hidden throughout

# Hualien
Hualien is a 2-hour express train ride from Taipei. Puyuma or Taroko Express trains are recommended. They also serve bento boxes on the train that you can reserve ahead of time or buy at the station. 

It is a small town on the east coast of Taiwan that is a nice retreat from the bustling city of Taipei. I would recommend spending a day exploring the town and 1-2 days in Taroko National Park. Many hotels provide shuttles to the entrance of Taroko where you can then take the park's shuttle. (We rented a car and drove ourselves to Taroko since we also needed a car for our bonus day trip to Taitung.)

## Things to do
1. Hualien Cultural and Creative Industries Park
2. Explore the beach
3. Night Market
4. [Taroko National Park](#taroko-national-park)

## Things to eat
1. Er Ge Beef Noodle
2. Dai Ji Wonton
3. Wang's Tea House

# Hualien Day Trips
## Taroko National Park

{: .box-warning}
*Check the official park page for announcements of road closures. There are usually many road closures on the road leading through the park due to landslides and maintanence. The closures have set times and will usually allow cars through for around 5-10 minutes each hour or two.*

### Shakadang Trail
**(3-4 hours)**

A fairly easy hike at the entrance of the park. There's a small parking lot near the Shakadang bridge's entrance.

### Enternal Spring Shring Trail (Changchun Trail)
**(1 hour)**

A fairly easy circuit trail that leads toe the Changuang Temple with a parking lot at the start.

### The Swallow Grotto (Yanzikou Trail)
**(0.5 hours)**

An easy trail that takes you under the rocks. It is recommended to wear a helmet when walking through. There is limited parking available at the west trailhead (at Zhuilu Cliff)

<div class="section" markdown="1">
<div class="paragraphs" markdown="1">
### Zhuilu Old Road Trail
**(5-6 hours)**

The most popular and unique trail at the park is the **Zhuilu Old Road Trail** that takes you up the mountain and above the clouds. 

This trail is not for the faint of heart and required a Park Entry Permit. There are a limited amounts of permits per day and are usually completely reserved months ahead of time. The ticket booth and check-in for this trail is at the Swallow Grotto Tail East Entrance and there's a fee of NT$200.

### Tunnel of Nine Turns Trail
**(0.5 hours)**

An easy tunnel hike that takes you through a tunnel on the edge of a cliff - allowing you to see out the side of the cliff. 

There is no parking at the trailhead - only a drop-off point. It is recommended to take the shuttle bus to this trail.

### Tianxiang
This is a small town in the national park; a good place to grab a bite to eat or stay overnight. There is also a temple high up in the mountains on the edge of town.

### Baiyang Waterfall Trail
**(1.5 hours)**

A faily easy trail that takes you behind a water curtain. It is recommended to bring a flashlight and rain gear. There is a faily large parking lot across the street from the trailhead.

## Taitung, Mr Brown Avenue
<div class="section" markdown="1">
<div class="side-img" markdown="1">

</div>
<div class="paragraphs" markdown="1">
2-hours away from Hualien, in Taitung, Mr Brown Avenue is a mile long stretch of road that goes through the rice fields. It is only accessible by bike or foot - no vehicles are allowed on this road.

I would recommend renting an electric bike at the Chishang Train Station and biking to Brown Boulevard - with the added bonus of biking around Dapo Pond. There are many places along Brown Boulevard to stop and take in the views, such as the Chishang Huge Waterwheel and the Great View Pavilion.

### Bonus: Teahouse

Nu Er Bu Dong Cha is an amazing tea shop ran by a local woman that crafted her own tea flavors inspired by her surroundings.

# YouBike
YouBikes are public bikes with docking stations all around Taipei. Contrary to what other sites may say, **you do not need a Taipei phone number to rent**. If you do have one, you are able to link your EasyCard to your phone number and pay using the EasyCard. 

For those that do not have a Taipei phone number, you are able to use your credit card to pay. **YouBike 1.0** have kiosks near the bike docks that allows you to pay with card (it accepts international credit cards and no internet access is needed). **YouBike 2.0** will not have a kiosk nearby and will require you to have internet access. First, you'll need to download the YouBike 2.0 app on your mobile device and use it to scan the QR code or enter the 4-digit code that's on the screen of the bike to unlock the bike. The app will allow you to enter your credit card information and pay. In both cases, it will put a hold on your credit card with a charge equivalent to losing the bike. Then, when the bike is returned to a dock, it calculates how long the bike was used and charges the card - the inital hold will disappear within a couple of business days.
