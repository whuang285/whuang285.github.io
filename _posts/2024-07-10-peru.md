_Peru is a land of contrasts, where ancient history meets breathtaking landscapes, and vibrant cities give way to tranquil beaches. In this travel adventure, we'll explore two drastically different destinations in Peru: the historic city of Cusco and the sunny shores of Máncora. Whether you're drawn to the rich cultural heritage of the Inca Empire or seeking a relaxing coastal getaway, Peru has something for everyone._

### **Accomodations Tips**
We visited during Peru's winter, when temperatures can drop significantly at night. Many accommodations do not have central heating; instead, we were provided with a space heater. However, this did not warm the entire place and could not be left on overnight. Temperatures ranged from 20°F at night to 60°F midday. 

When booking accommodations, look for places that offer additional amenities such as airport pickup service and tour packages. We took advantage of these amenities, booking last-minute tours to Rainbow Mountain and the Moray Salt Mines through our accommodation.


### **Day 1-2: Arrival in Cusco and Acclimating to the Altitude**
After landing in Lima and transferring to Cusco, the first thing you'll notice is the change in altitude. At 11,152 feet above sea level, it's essential to give your body time to acclimate. Cusco, the former capital of the Inca Empire, is a charming city filled with narrow cobblestone streets, colonial architecture, and vibrant markets.

- **Day 1 (Arrival)**: Settle into your accommodations and enjoy a light lunch in one of Cusco's many cafés. Walk through the city’s main square, Plaza de Armas, where you can admire the Cathedral and the Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús. 
- **Dinner Suggestions**: Head to *Chicha por Gastón Acurio* for a modern twist on traditional Peruvian dishes or *Cicciolina* for a cozy tapas experience.

- **Day 2 (Acclimation)**: Spend the day exploring Cusco at a leisurely pace. Visit the bohemian San Blas neighborhood, home to artisan workshops and galleries. Later, check out the San Pedro Market, where you can try fresh fruit juices and traditional Andean street food.
- **Nearby Ruins**: If you’re feeling adventurous, visit the Inca ruins just outside of Cusco, such as Sacsayhuamán or Tambomachay.

### **Day 3: Machu Picchu – A Wonder of the World**

No trip to Peru is complete without visiting Machu Picchu. We started the day early, taking a bus from Cusco to Ollantaytambo, followed by a scenic train ride to Aguas Calientes. After a short bus ride, we reached the entrance to Machu Picchu, where we spent the day exploring the ancient Inca citadel. The breathtaking sight of this wonder nestled high in the Andes made the early start well worth the effort.

- **Circuit Options & Booking Tips**: Machu Picchu offers several hiking circuits, and it's essential to plan well in advance—especially if you're interested in Circuit 2, which is the most popular. Tickets often need to be booked several months ahead of time, as visitor numbers are limited and the circuits are continuously being adjusted to manage crowds.

    - **Circuit 1**: Takes you above the ruins, offering stunning panoramic views of Machu Picchu and the surrounding mountains.
    - **Circuit 2**: The most comprehensive path, it goes both above the ruins and through them, giving you a chance to experience the site from multiple perspectives.
    - **Circuit 3**: Focuses on the interior of the ruins, allowing visitors to get up close to the ancient structures.

  **Our Experience**: We wanted to experience both the elevated views above Machu Picchu and a closer look at the ruins, but Circuit 2 was fully booked. Instead, we opted to combine Circuit 1 in the morning for the views and Circuit 3 in the afternoon to explore the ruins up close. This was a great way to see both the grandeur of the site and the intricate details of the ancient architecture.

   Be sure to book your tickets for Machu Picchu well in advance to secure your preferred circuits, especially if you're set on Circuit 2. Also, consider combining circuits like we did to experience both the sweeping views and the interior of the ruins.

- **Travel Tip**: While we started our journey from Cusco, which required a longer travel time, there are options to stay closer to Machu Picchu, such as in the Sacred Valley. Staying there allows you to take the train directly from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes, skipping the extra leg from Cusco to Ollantaytambo. The lower elevation in the Sacred Valley is also beneficial for acclimating to altitude, making it a great option for those who want a more relaxed journey.

### **Day 4-5: Sacred Valley, Rainbow Mountain, and More of Cusco**
If you're up for more adventure, consider spending **Day 4** exploring the Sacred Valley. This region is home to charming towns like Ollantaytambo and Pisac, where you can delve into more Inca ruins and enjoy bustling local markets. These towns provide a great opportunity to experience traditional Andean culture and craftsmanship.

Alternatively, if you're looking for a more strenuous adventure, consider a trip to Rainbow Mountain (Vinicunca). Known for its vibrant, multicolored slopes, Rainbow Mountain offers a breathtaking and unique trekking experience. The elevation at Rainbow Mountain is approximately 16,500 feet (5,000 meters), which can be quite challenging. If you're feeling unwell or experiencing altitude sickness, it might be best to skip this trek.

- **Sacred Valley Highlights**: Spend time exploring Ollantaytambo's impressive archaeological site and the local market in Pisac. Both locations offer a deep dive into the rich history and culture of the Inca Empire.

- **Rainbow Mountain**: For those who are up for the challenge, this trek rewards you with otherworldly views of colorful mountains. Make sure to be well-prepared for high altitudes and bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection. Be mindful of the elevation, and ensure you are acclimated to avoid altitude sickness.

- **Cusco**: If you prefer a less strenuous day, you can also explore more of Cusco's attractions or take a day to relax and adjust to the altitude. This can be a good option if you are feeling the effects of the high elevation.

**Day 5: Moray and Travel to Lima**  
On our final day in Cusco, we visited the Moray salt mines, an ancient Incan site located in the Sacred Valley. This fascinating site features a series of terraced circular depressions used for salt evaporation. Moray provides insight into traditional agricultural practices and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.

After exploring Moray, we headed back to Cusco in time for an early afternoon flight to Lima, setting the stage for the next leg of our Peruvian journey.

### **Day 6-9: Welcome to Máncora**  
After the history and high altitudes of Cusco, it’s time to head to the coast for some sun, sand, and relaxation. Máncora, located in northern Peru, is a laid-back beach town known for its surf spots, fresh seafood, and vibrant nightlife.

- **Relaxing at the Beach**: Spend your days lounging by the ocean, trying your hand at surfing, or exploring nearby beaches like Vichayito and Las Pocitas. Máncora’s warm waters, even during the winter, make it an ideal spot for swimming and water activities.
  
- **Dining by the Sea**: Enjoy fresh ceviche at local seafood joints or dine at beachfront restaurants offering traditional Peruvian dishes with a coastal twist.

We were in Máncora for a wedding but had plenty of time to relax and swim. The water was surprisingly warm despite being winter. One of the highlights of our stay was booking a place that provided a private cook. Although the food wasn't fancy, it was authentic and delicious. We discovered that having the cook prepare our meals was not only easier but also more cost-effective than grocery shopping and cooking for ourselves. 

Our accommodation was located outside the town of Máncora so transportation was challenging without a car. We often had to rely on private taxis or tuk-tuks to get around. Taking a tuk-tuk is a fun and affordable experience that we highly recommend. However, be sure to carry cash in small bills and be cautious to avoid being overcharged.

### **Day 10-12: Return to Lima**  
After a wonderful weekend in Máncora, return to Lima for the final leg of your trip. Take the opportunity to explore more of the capital’s vibrant neighborhoods and cultural offerings.

- **Explore Barranco**: Spend time in the bohemian district of Barranco, known for its colorful street art, eclectic galleries, and lively cafés. Stroll along the Puente de los Suspiros (Bridge of Sighs) and soak in the artistic atmosphere of this charming neighborhood.

- **Historical District**: Don’t miss a visit to Lima’s **historic center**, where you can explore the grand **Plaza de Armas**, home to the beautiful **Lima Cathedral** and the **Government Palace**. The cathedral, with its impressive baroque architecture, is a must-see and a great spot to learn more about Lima’s colonial history. While there, consider visiting the **San Francisco Monastery** with its famous catacombs.

- **Food Suggestions**:
   - **Maido**: A world-renowned restaurant offering an incredible fusion of Peruvian and Japanese flavors. Perfect for a special dinner experience.
   - **Isolina**: A popular spot for hearty, traditional Peruvian dishes, ideal for a filling lunch after a morning of exploring. Make sure to try their famous "lomo saltado" or "ají de gallina."

- **Accommodation Suggestion**: Stay near **Miraflores**, one of the most vibrant and tourist-friendly areas of Lima. It offers beautiful parks, ocean views, and easy access to top restaurants and shops. 

	Miraflores is also a great base for taking leisurely walks along the **Malecón**, a cliffside path with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean, or visiting **Parque Kennedy** for some local culture and craft shopping.

**Travel Tips**:
- **Altitude Acclimation**: Take it slow in Cusco for the first day or two to help your body adjust to the high altitude. Consider drinking coca tea or chewing coca leaves, which locals recommend to ease symptoms.
- **Booking Machu Picchu**: Be sure to book your tickets to Machu Picchu in advance, as visitor numbers are limited, and certain circuits (like Circuit 2) fill up quickly.
- **Beach Essentials**: Don’t forget sunscreen, a hat, and swimwear for your time in Máncora. Even during the winter months, the water is surprisingly warm.
- **Cash**: Definitely have a method for getting cash. Conversion rates are often better when withdrawing or exchanging currency in Peru. Consider using a Charles Schwab debit card, which reimburses ATM fees and offers favorable rates.
- **Weather**: Peru’s climate varies dramatically depending on where you are. While it doesn’t get extremely cold, the lack of central heating in many accommodations means packing warm clothes for Cusco’s cold nights is essential. Also, pack layers, as daytime temperatures can get warm, especially under the sun.
